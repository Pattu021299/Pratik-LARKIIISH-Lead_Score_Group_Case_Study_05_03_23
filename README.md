It's a Logistic regression based model building to predict the best features which can be targeted by the X Education team for selling their courses. This case study aims at building a Logistic regression model for X education company to predict potential leads and thus increase the Lead conversion rate from 30% to 80%

CONCLUSION:

INSIGHTS FROM EDA:

 Target variable has Data imbalance. 62% peoples are not converted while 38% people are converted.

 Most of the lead sources are either from Google or they are Direct Traffic. While leads from Google and Organic Search have high conversion rate compared to others.

 People who are Unemployed have shown most interest in the course. While working professional people have shown a greater number of conversions followed by unemployed people. X-education should target Working professional people more for higher lead conversion.

 People who have expectation of “Better Career Prospects” have largely shown interest in this course with almost 50% conversion. X- education should focus on providing more career opportunities along with course to get more lead conversions.

 People who have sent the SMS to X-education have shown huge conversion. X-education should focus on LEAD who have contacted X-Education through similar SMS.

TOP VARIABLE CONTRIBUTING TO CONVERSION:

 LEAD SOURCE: o Total Time Spent on Website

 Lead Origin: o Lead Add Form

 Lead source: o Welingak website

 Occupation: o Working professional

X education can use the above model on new leads to predict the probability of conversion for each LEAD. Also, it can use the model prediction to classify a LEAD as potential LEAD, to obtain 80% conversion rate.
